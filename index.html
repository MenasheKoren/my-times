      <h1>Mother of Three Buys Tuna Steak at Phish Concert. Leaves, "Feeling Funny.''</h1>
      <p>MONUMENT VALLEY, AZ - Once you learn the technique, ohhh! Turn you loose on the world; you become a tiger. There's not a thing in the world wrong with washing your brush. This is your creation - and it's just as unique and special as you are. And I will hypnotize that just a little bit. The shadows are just like the highlights, but we're going in the opposite direction. A little happy sunlight shining through there. We'll paint one happy little tree right here. There isn't a rule. You just practice and find out which way works best for you. I sincerely wish for you every possible joy life could bring. You have to allow the paint to break to make it beautiful. If it's not what you want - stop and change it. Don't just keep going and expect it will get better. See there, told you that would be easy.</p>

      <h2>Orca Spends Vacation at Land World Puget</h2>
      <p>PUGET, SO - Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. Nice little clouds playing around in the sky. We tell people sometimes: we're like drug dealers, come into town and get everybody absolutely addicted to painting. It doesn't take much to get you addicted. There is immense joy in just watching - watching all the little creatures in nature. If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is.</p>

      <h3>Earth Spins Backwards for 2017</h3>

      <h2>Burger for Breakfast: How Early is too Early?</h2>
      <p>New York, NY - Everyone needs a friend. Friends are the most valuable things in the world. It's a super day, so why not make a beautiful sky?</p>

      <h2>FBI Finds Action Star Guilty of False Advertising</h2>
      <p>WASHINGTON DC - Use what you see, don't plan it. We'll throw some old gray clouds in here just sneaking around and having fun. Paint anything you want on the canvas. Create your own world. We tell people sometimes: we're like drug dealers, come into town and get everybody absolutely addicted to painting. It doesn't take much to get you addicted.</p>
