      <p>MONUMENT VALLEY, AZ - Once you learn the technique, ohhh! Turn you loose on the world; you become a tiger. There's not a thing in the world wrong with washing your brush. This is your creation - and it's just as unique and special as you are. And I will hypnotize that just a little bit. The shadows are just like the highlights, but we're going in the opposite direction. A little happy sunlight shining through there. We'll paint one happy little tree right here. There isn't a rule. You just practice and find out which way works best for you. I sincerely wish for you every possible joy life could bring. You have to allow the paint to break to make it beautiful. If it's not what you want - stop and change it. Don't just keep going and expect it will get better. See there, told you that would be easy.</p>

There is immense joy in just watching - watching all the little creatures in nature. If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is.</p>

      <p>BROOKLYN, NY - And right there you got an almighty cloud. It's so important to do something every day that will make you happy. Just a happy little shadow that lives in there.
